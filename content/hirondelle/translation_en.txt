misery isn't eternal
you don't know but I see it
under the rain, a swallow
messenger of our path
take my place and then entwine
behind a mask, i vanish
calm waters like a preface
your gift like a trace

temptation is out there
a nation's weapon is already gone
flower perish on her path
hearts get a new treatment

misery isn't eternal
you don't know but I see it
under the rain, a swallow
messenger of our path
take my place and then entwine
behind a mask, i vanish
calm waters like a preface
your gift like a trace

the vision is very clear
it's made to seduce me
the game is already closed
everything is gonna be over soon

misery isn't eternal
you don't know but I see it
under the rain, a swallow
messenger of our path
take my place and then entwine
behind a mask, i vanish
calm waters like a preface
your gift like a trace
