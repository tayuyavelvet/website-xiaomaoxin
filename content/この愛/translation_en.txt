In the mist, you run away

And you know, I thought we didn’t love each other that much
I don’t have the words, and among all my woes,
The worst are those that make me believe there’s only you out there
All paths are guided by your sweet voice

This love is difficult. But I love you
What are we making? Why are we alive?
I’m a lonely person. Please come with me
This love is difficult. But I love you
What are we making? Why are we alive?
I’m a lonely person. Please come with me

And you know that in the end, I won’t die in your arms
That’s why beneath these sheets, I hold you close to me
The future is uncertain—does loving make sense?
Don’t worry, I won’t bail out on you

The memory of your arms, you know I carry it with me
And there’s no harm in it, you get yourself into these moods
From your state, I want to create a sparkle
Come on, meet me over there, we’ll leave together

This love is difficult. But I love you
What are we making? Why are we alive?
I’m a lonely person. Please come with me
This love is difficult. But I love you
What are we making? Why are we alive?
I’m a lonely person. Please come with me
