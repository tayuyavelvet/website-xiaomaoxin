baby cries in my arms
come over here and hold me tight
baby i'm crying in your arms
in the morning you'll be mad at me

baby scream, yes, sex me
tomorrow once again
take your hand and prove to me
that you deserve to undo my sheets

temptation is not far away
you scream at the thrust of your loins
the moon lights your face
and your breasts, a landscape

new passion, slip,
tonight my bed you share
the sun tints in the hollow of your hands
I know you want more, I know you like that

baby cries in my arms
come over here and hold me tight
baby i'm crying in your arms
in the morning you'll be mad at me

baby scream, yes, sex me
tomorrow once again
take your hand and prove to me
that you deserve to undo my sheets

baby scream, yes, sex me
tomorrow once again
take your hand and prove to me
that you deserve to undo my sheets
